# Solar Calculator
---
An attempt was made to create an application that would allow users to calculate the approximate nominal power of solar panels placed on a given map. The user is given the power to draw shapes representing collections of solar panels on a map provided by the google map API. I used the google map API documentation extensively for this project. Other influences are cited in my code.

## Dependencies
To use this application, follow these steps;

1. Clone the project

2. Initiate npm in the command line via `npm init -y`

3. Install the packages by pasting and running the following into your command line: `npm install --save babel-core@6.26.0 babel-loader@7.1.2 babel-preset-es2015@6.24.1 babel-preset-react@6.24.1 react@16.2.0 react-dom@16.2.0 react-router-dom@4.2.2 webpack@3.10.0`

4. Copy the full path of the index.html file into your browser and you are set to go!
